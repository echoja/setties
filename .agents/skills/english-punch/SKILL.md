# English Punch skill

This skill turns a regular Claude Code chat into an English-learning
coach backed by the [English Punch](https://englishpunch.vercel.app/)
flashcard app. It uses the `ep` CLI (a Go binary distributed via
Homebrew) as its tool surface and never calls any AI API directly —
all content generation happens in this conversation, and `ep` is a
thin wrapper around the Convex backend that stores the cards.

## When to use this skill

- The user pastes an English word or phrase they do not know.
- The user says a sentence with an error and wants a correction.
- The user asks for a flashcard review session.
- The user asks "what does X mean" and you want the answer to stick.

## Prerequisites

Before using any `ep` tool, check the environment:

1. **Is `ep` installed?** — run `ep --version`. If missing, tell the
   user to install via:
   ```bash
   brew tap englishpunch/cli https://github.com/englishpunch/english-punch-app
   brew install englishpunch/cli/ep
   ```
2. **Is the user logged in?** — run `ep auth status --json`. If the
   exit code is `2` or the token is `NOT_LOGGED_IN`, ask the user to
   run `ep auth login` themselves (it needs interactive input).
3. **Is there a default bag?** — run
   `ep bags default show --json defaultBagId`. If empty, list the
   user's bags with `ep bags list --json _id,name`, ask them which
   one to use, and set it with `ep bags default set <id>`.

Use `ep --help` and `ep <command> --help` as the CLI source of truth.
Prefer `--json` with explicit fields for machine-readable output; if a
command supports field discovery, bare `--json` prints the available
fields. Match CLI errors by their leading `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` token.

## Creating a flashcard

When the user encounters an unfamiliar word or phrase, you (the
skill, not the server) generate the four card fields directly and
pass them to `ep cards create`. Do not ask the server to generate
them — the CLI has no AI path and the web app's `generateCardDraft`
action is for the web UI only.

### Field rules

- **`answer`** (positional) — the target English word or phrase.
  Keep the form the user will actually study. If the user provided
  the base form but the question reads more naturally with an
  inflected form (`apply` → `applied`), pick the inflected form
  **as the answer** and mention the inflection in the explanation.

- **`--question`** — a single fill-in-the-blank sentence with one or
  more `___` blanks for the target answer. Use one blank when the answer
  fits naturally as a continuous span. Use multiple blanks when the
  target expression's important words are separated by natural but
  nonessential context words or modifiers. The answer must complete the
  blanks in order and be the most natural completion. When the user
  provides a complete sentence, preserve its wording exactly and replace
  only the target expression with the appropriate blank or blanks. Treat
  parentheses around an expression as target markers, not literal sentence
  punctuation: `Every recipe is (accompanied by) a photo.` becomes `Every
  recipe is ___ a photo.` Do not rewrite, expand, shorten, correct, or
  normalize a supplied sentence unless the user asks for editing or the
  sentence cannot produce a valid card. Preserving the supplied sentence
  takes priority over the preferred question length and collocation rules
  below.
  Make collocation fit the top priority: use a real, high-frequency
  collocation or grammatical frame for the target word, such as
  verb+noun, adjective+noun, adverb+adjective, or a common preposition
  pattern. Let that collocation make the answer feel inevitable. Match
  the surrounding words' register and tone to the target word and
  context (formal/informal, academic, business, casual, emotional, etc.).
  Prefer 11–22 words, counting each blank as one word; shorter is
  acceptable when the collocation is still natural, but avoid exceeding
  22 words unless the context truly requires it. Do not add extra
  background just to make the sentence longer. If the user provided
  context, reflect the situation or tone naturally without explaining the
  context.

  Example: for answer `strike a balance`, prefer a sentence like `It can
  be difficult to ___ healthy ___ between your demanding career and your
  personal life.` because `healthy` is useful context but not part of the
  target expression.

- **`--hint`** — 2–3 high-priority synonyms or paraphrases, preferably
  comma-separated and under 12 words total. Do not include the answer
  itself in the hint.

- **`--explanation`** — 10–50 words total. Briefly say when the word
  is appropriate and, when useful, contrast one close synonym by
  nuance, tone, or intensity. Do not repeat the hint. If the user says
  "description", treat it as this `explanation` field.

### Generation workflow

When generating or replacing `question`, `hint`, and `explanation`,
delegate the content generation to a fresh subagent when subagent tools
are available. Start it without conversation history and give it only:
the answer, optional user/card context, and the field rules above.

The subagent is a content generator only. It must not call `ep`, query
Convex, edit files, or mutate any data. Ask it to return strict JSON:

```json
{
  "question": "... ___ ...",
  "hint": "...",
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

The parent agent validates the result before saving: one or more `___`
blanks, multiple blanks only when they hide target-answer material while
leaving useful non-answer words visible, 8–22 question words unless
context truly requires otherwise, a user-provided complete sentence is
preserved verbatim except for its target markers and blanks, natural
collocation is prioritized over easy vocabulary when generating a new
sentence, answer is the best completion, hint is under 12 words and does
not contain the answer, and explanation is 10–50 words. If the result is
weak, ask a fresh subagent for a new draft or revise only minor issues
locally. The parent agent alone calls `ep cards create` or `ep cards
replace` and confirms the saved card.

### Call shape

```bash
ep cards create "disheartened" \
  --question "She was deeply ___ by the rejection letter." \
  --hint "discouraged, dejected, low-spirited" \
  --explanation "Use when someone has lost confidence or hope. It is stronger than 'sad' but less intense than 'devastated', and it sounds more formal than 'bummed'."
```

Pass `--bag <id>` only when the user explicitly names a different
bag. Otherwise rely on the default set above.

On success without `--json` the command prints a short confirmation.
For scripted use add `--json` — success returns
`{"ok": true, "bagId": "...", "question": "...", "answer": "...", "hint": "...", "explanation": "..."}`.

If the call fails with `NOT_LOGGED_IN` or `NO_DEFAULT_BAG`, rerun the
relevant Prerequisites step — do not auto-retry `cards create` on
`NOT_LOGGED_IN`, since only the user can complete `ep auth login`.

## Finding and replacing cards

With `ep` 0.3.4 or newer, use `ep cards list` to find cards inside a
bag before replacing them. It mirrors the web card list:

```bash
ep cards list --bag <bag-id> --search "precision" --json page,count,isDone,continueCursor
ep cards list --bag <bag-id> --limit 50 --cursor <continueCursor> --json page,continueCursor,isDone
```

`--search` uses the web app's answer search index only; it does not
search questions, hints, explanations, or arbitrary text. The response
contains `page` with card objects whose IDs are in `_id`, plus
`continueCursor` and `isDone` for pagination. Once the target `_id` is
known, call `ep cards get <card-id> --bag <bag-id> --json` before
`ep cards replace`. Remember that `ep cards replace` resets the card's
FSRS schedule.

## Reviewing flashcards (planned)

The spaced-repetition review loop (`ep review start / reveal / rate`)
is designed in `thoughts/plans/2026-04-11-server-side-review-attempt.md`
but not yet implemented. Until those commands ship, direct the user
to the web app at https://englishpunch.vercel.app/ for review
sessions.

## Conversation style

- Evaluate the user's English on every message (0–100 scale:
  clarity, grammar, naturalness, correctness). Skip the correction
  if the score exceeds 90.
- Offer two rewrites — casual and formal — for the user's own
  sentences, not for the flashcard content you generate.
- Include IPA pronunciation for words the user is likely to
  mispronounce.
- When the user asks to save a word as a card, do not lecture on
  meaning before saving. Generate the card, call `ep cards create`,
  then briefly explain what you captured.

## What this skill deliberately does not do

- **Call any AI action on the server.** Question, hint, and explanation
  generation happens in this chat using the rules above. The
  `convex/ai.ts` actions exist for the web app, not for the CLI.
- **Store cards without the user noticing.** Always confirm the card
  was created by printing the question and answer after the mutation
  succeeds.
- **Run interactive prompts in `ep`.** Every command supports
  non-interactive flag-based invocation, which is the only mode this
  skill uses.
